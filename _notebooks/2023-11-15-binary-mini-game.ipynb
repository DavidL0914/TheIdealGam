    "- Players will be given a certain number of turns to complete a task. \n",
    "- Different regions can be unlocked which can provide access to harder words as well as powerups that allow you to skip certain words to receive assitance. \n",

    "- Challenge the user to really think about binary, and how the binary alphabet works\n",

    "**How will we accomplish this?**\n",
    "- Provide tasks that gradually become more difficult. I.E if there is a wall, the player must type out wall in binary in order to scale the wall\n",

    "- JavaScript, HTML & a bit of CSS\n",
    "- List operations\n",
